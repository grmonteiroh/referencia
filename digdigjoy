Explanation:

Data Preparation:

The code begins by reading the account balance data and preparing it for analysis.
It calculates the daily change in balance to determine withdrawals.
Average daily withdrawals are computed for each account.
Time to Zero Balance:

For each account, the time it would take for the balance to reach zero is calculated, assuming withdrawals continue at the average rate and no new deposits are made.
Accounts with no withdrawals are considered censored in the survival analysis.
Kaplan-Meier Estimation:

The Kaplan-Meier estimator is used to estimate the survival function, representing the probability that accounts still have a positive balance over time.
The survival curve is plotted to visualize the declining proportion of accounts with a positive balance.
Simulating Total Balance Over Time:

The code simulates the total balance of the entire portfolio over time by summing the simulated balances of all accounts.
It accounts for both accounts with ongoing withdrawals and those without.
Estimating Time to Zero Total Balance:

By analyzing the simulated total balance over time, the code estimates when the total balance of the portfolio will reach zero.
It prints out this estimated time, providing a direct answer to the original question.
Note:

Replace 'account_balances.csv' with the actual path to your data file.
Ensure all necessary libraries (pandas, numpy, lifelines, matplotlib) are installed in your Python environment.
The code assumes that withdrawals will continue at the historical average rate and that no new deposits will be made, as per the problem statement.
